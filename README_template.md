# Heroes of Valor player ranking

Last updated: **%DATE%** (updated every 6 hours)

This leaderboard is derived from the two official leaderboards found here:

- Total score: <https://steamcommunity.com/stats/2504090/leaderboards/16656646>
- PvP score: <https://steamcommunity.com/stats/2504090/leaderboards/16808192>

The last "Score ratio" column shows the player's PvP score divided by their
total score. A higher number indicates that the player mostly plays against
other players; a low number means the player primarily plays against bots, or
gains score from other non-PvP sources (e.g. hosting servers).

The official leaderboards only show 200 entries each. For players who are not
on both leaderboards, we cannot calculate the exact score ratio (since one of
the variables is unknown), but we can determine its minimum and maximum
possible value. For these players, the minimum and maximum values are shown.

Players are ranked based on their exact score ratio (if known), or their
lowest possible score ratio (if unknown).
